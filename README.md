### Figure 1. Circos Chord Diagram of Outcome Flow Circular
Circular chord diagram showing how PAS cases and controls distribute into each of the four clusters. Clusters 1 and 2 go with PAS cases; 3 and 4 with controls. Ribbon width corresponds to the number of patients in each cluster.

### Figure 2a. t-SNE Plots Colored by Cluster
Two-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plot. Each point is a patient colored by PAM cluster (1 = blue, 2 = green, 3 = orange, 4 = red), illustrating separation into four and six clusters. This visualization helps in understanding the distribution and relationships of data points within and between clusters.

### Supplemental Figure t-SNE Plots Colored by Case or Control (not on poster)
Same t-SNE layout as Figure 2a, but with color indicating clinical outcome (PAS case or control). This view highlights that Clusters 1–2 are predominantly PAS cases and Clusters 3–4 are predominantly controls.

### Figure 3. Heatmap of Key Blood Markers by Cluster 
Heatmap of standardized median values for selected hematologic markers: lymphocytes (LYMPH), neutrophils (NEUT), platelet count (PLT), hemoglobin (HG), red cell distribution width (RDW), mean platelet volume (MPV), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NtoLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLT), hemoglobin (HG), red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PtoLR), across timepoints 1-3.  Annotations include QBL in mL (white to green), cohort (case = red, control = blue), and clusters (1-4). Rows and columns are clustered using Ward D2 with maximum distance scores.
